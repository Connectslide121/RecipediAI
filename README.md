# RecipediAI

A recipe website. Search for recipes by ingredient, cuisine etc... or tell an AI whatever you think is relevant and they will suggest a whole menu! 

-Tell them about this special dinner that you need to organize
-Tell them if you are pregnant, vegetarian, allergic to nuts...
-Tell them that you are trying to lose weight, or gain weight!

An OpenAI API key is required for AI functionality.

The app uses [Edamam API](https://www.edamam.com/) to get the recipes.
